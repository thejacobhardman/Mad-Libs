# Mad Libs

This is a simple Mad Libs game based off of "Monty Python and the Quest for the Holy Grail."

You will need to have the 'Outline.txt' file in the same folder as the 'MadLibs.py' file or the program will not work.

This is a longer Mad Libs so don't worry if it seems like it is dragging on, it will pay off in the end.

You will have the option to save your custom Mad Lib into a new .txt file if you would like to do so.
